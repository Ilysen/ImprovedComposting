You can find them <a href=\"handbook://block-looseores-nativecopper-granite-free\">loose</a> on the ground, which also indicate an underground deposit. You can also find them in <a href=\"handbook://block-lootvessel-ore\">cracked vessels</a>, through <a href=\"handbook://gamemechanicinfo-panning\">panning</a> sand and gravel or by purchasing them from traders. Acquire <a href=\"handbook://craftinginfo-charcoalburning\">charcoal</a> and smelt the copper on a firepit. See also: <a href=\"handbook://craftinginfo-smelting\">Smelting Guide</a>.
